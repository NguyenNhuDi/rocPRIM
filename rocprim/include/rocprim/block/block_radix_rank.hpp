BEGIN_ROCPRIM_NAMESPACE

/// \brief The block_radix_rank class is a blcok level parallel primitives which provides
/// methods for ranking items partitioned across threads in a block. This algorithm
/// associates each item with the index it would gain if the keys were sorted into an array,
/// according to a radix comparison. Ranking is performed in a stable manner.
///
/// \tparam BlockSizeX - the number of threads in a block's x dimension.
/// \tparam RadixBits - the maximum number of radix digit bits that comparisons are performed by.
/// \tparam MemoizeOuterScan - whether to cache digit counters in local memory. This omits loading
/// the same values from shared memory twice, at the expense of more register usage.
/// \tparam BlockSizeY - the number of threads in a block's y dimension, defaults to 1.
/// \tparam BlockSizeZ - the number of threads in a block's z dimension, defaults to 1.
///
/// \par Overview
/// * Key type must be an arithmetic type (that is, an integral type or a floating point type).
/// * Performance depends on the block size and the number of items that will be sorted per thread.
///     * It is usually better if the block size is a multiple of th size of the hardware warp.
///     * It is usually increased when there are more than one item per thread. However, when there are too
///     many items per thread, each thread may need so much registers and/or shared memory.
/// * Shared memory usage deoends on the block size, and the maximum number of radix bits that will be
/// considered when comparing keys.
///     * The storage increases when more bits are considered.
///
/// \par Examples
/// In the example, radix rank is performed on a block of 128 threads. Each thread provides
/// three \p float values, which are ranked according to bits 10 through 14. The results are
/// written back in a separate array of three <tt>unsigned int</tt> values.
///
